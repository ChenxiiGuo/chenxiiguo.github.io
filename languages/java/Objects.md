## Learning blog
If there are some interesting things, I will post them in two repositories. One is about [algorithms and datastructure](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/DataStructure-Algorithm), the [other](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/learningNotes) is about languages.

Now, I add a new blog which is more comfortable to read. You can visit is [here](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/chenxiiguo.github.io/blob/master/techBlog.md).

## Introduction of Finished Projects

### [GlomPaint]
##### [Source code of GlomPaint] | Key words: Java, JavaFX, Algorithms, GUI
The aim of this project is to develop a software which is used to help AI researchers to label images.
The weired name GlomPaint comes from my project developed for Bristol Renal Team and the purpose of this project is to develop a software which could detect glomeruli(a group of vessels in kidney) and calculate their size.

### [HomeDB](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/javaProjects#introdution-of-homedb)
##### [Source code of HomeDB] | Key words: Java, Datastructure
The aim of this project is to develop a homemade database. It is also based on tree(TreeMap rather than B-tree) and it supports 11 different queries.

### [TeletextParser](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/cProjects#introduction-of-teltextparser)
##### [Source code of TeletextParser] | Key words: C, Hash, Image Recognition, Computer Architecture
The project contains three different parts. The first part is "telToImage" which transfer [Teletext](http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/tccgen/manual/tcgen2.html) to a kind of [images](http://teletext.mb21.co.uk/gallery/ceefax/main1.shtml). The second part is "imageToTel" which transfer an image into a series of Teletext code. Some image recognition methods are used. The third part is to do unit test.

### [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/cProjects#introduction-of-binarysearchtree)
##### [Source code of Binary Search Tree] | Key words: C, Datastructure, Algorithms
This project contains four different parts. The first part is to build a binary search tree and develop some methods for it, such as simple print, calculation of the depth, reblance a binary search tree and so on. The second part is to develop a program which could print binary search tree with its structure, so it is also called "Prettier Print". The third part is to develop a hash table and compare the difference between the BST and hash table. The fourth part is to do some research on threaded binary tree.

### [PeliBook](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/groupWorks#introduction-of-pelibook)
##### [Source code of PeilBook] | Key words: Java, JavaFX, Teamwork, GUI, Algorithms, Game
In this project, we developed a game called PeliBook which could teach children how to use social medias. This game has been played by sevel children and they enjoy it.

### [FitnessSite](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/groupWorks#introduction-of-fitnesssite)
##### [Source code of FitnessSite] | Key words: JavaScript, Node.js, Web, Teamwork, database
In this project, we developed a [website](http://159.65.28.157:8090)(Please note that this website will be frequently updated and there will be some maintenance). We developed all program from scrach and both front-end, back-end and the database are designed and finished by ourselves.

## Introduction of ongoing projects

### [glomDetector](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/glomDetector/blob/master/readme.md#introduction-of-this-project)
##### [Source code of glomDetector] | Key words: Python, OpenCV, Computer Vision, Machine learning, CNNs, Image segmentation

In this project, a software will be developed and Bristol Renal Team will use it in their research. This software can detect glomeruli(a thing in kidney) and automatically calculate the volume of thw glomeruli. This [image](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/glomDetector/blob/master/Introduction/addedValue.png) shows the different between current method and improved method which is the aim of this project.
