## Introduction of Finished Projects

### [GlomPaint](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/javaProjects#introdution-of-glompaint)
This project is based on Java. It is a software which is used to help AI researchers to label images.

The name GlomPaint comes from my project developed for Bristol Renal Team and the purpose of this project is to develop a software which could detect glomeruli(a group of vessels in kidney) and calculate their size.
