## Introduction of Finished Projects

### [GlomPaint](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/javaProjects#introdution-of-glompaint)
#### Key words: Java, JavaFx, Algorithms, GUI
The aim of this project is to develop a software which is used to help AI researchers to label images.

The weired name GlomPaint comes from my project developed for Bristol Renal Team and the purpose of this project is to develop a software which could detect glomeruli(a group of vessels in kidney) and calculate their size.

### [HomeDB](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/javaProjects#introdution-of-homedb)
#### Key words: Java, Datastructure
The aim of this project is to develop a homemade database. It support 11 different queries.

### [TeltextParser](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/cProjects#introduction-of-teltextparser)
#### Key words: C, Hash, Image Recognition, Computer Architecture
The project contains three different parts.

The first part is "telToImage" which transfer [Teletext](http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/tccgen/manual/tcgen2.html) to a kind of image(http://teletext.mb21.co.uk/gallery/ceefax/main1.shtml).

The second part is "imageToTel" which transfer an image into a series of Teletext code. Some image recognition methods are used.

The third part is to do unit test.

### [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/ChenxiiGuo/cProjects#introduction-of-binarysearchtree)
#### Key words: C, Datastructure, Algorithms
This projects contains four different parts.

This first part is to build a binary search tree and develop some methods for it, such as simple print, calculation of the depth, reblance a binary search tree and so on.

The second part is to develop a program which could print binary search tree with its structure, so it is also called "Prettier Print"

The third part is to develop a hash table and compare the difference between the BST and hash table.

The fourth part is to do some research on threaded binary tree.
